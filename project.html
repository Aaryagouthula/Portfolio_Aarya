        <h1>Abnormal event detection on pathway using
            YOLO‚Äù</h1>
        <p>To enhance road safety and prevent accidents, this project focuses on developing a system to
            detect abnormal activities on roads in real-time. With YOLOv8, an object detection model,
            our approach aims to identify various irregularities such as accidents, reckless driving, and
            pedestrian crossings. Through a comprehensive training process and fine-tuning of the
            YOLOv8 model, we adapt it to the specific requirements of road safety monitoring. At the
            beginning of the configuration, we discuss combining Flask for web application development
            and Cloudinary for video storage which provides the user with user authentication, video
            processing, and streaming. In the end, it detects the specific objects in a video stream, records
            segments of the video when these objects are detected, and then uploads the recorded
            segments to Cloudinar.</p>
